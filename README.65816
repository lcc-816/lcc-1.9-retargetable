LCC-1.9-retargetable docs
by Toshiyasu Morita
-----------------------------------------------------

These are the instructions for the data-file driven retargetable version of
lcc. This was originally written in 1993-1994 before the backends for lcc were
provided in the lcc package. So, I wrote my own retargetable backend code
generator loosely inspired by BURG.

This package contains lcc with my retargetable code generator and the datafiles
for 65816 code generation originally used for the Apple //gs.

Build directions
----------------------------------------------------

First, build the lcc executable.
cd to the etc subdirectory and type "make".
Copy the a.out executable to /usr/local/bin/lcc.

Next, build the rcc exectable.
cd to gen0/vax-bsd/ and type "make".
Copy the rcc executable to /usr/local/bin/rcc.

Finally, build the dag2gs2 exectable.
cd to gen0 and type "make".
Copy the dag2gs2 executable to /usr/local/bin/dag2gs2.

Quick overview of how this works:
----------------------------------------------------

The lcc-1.9 compiler has been modified to emit raw DAGs into a .dag file.
This file contains the DAGs in prefix form.

There is a utility called dag2gs2 which converts the .dag files into assembly.
This dag2gs2 file is a tree-based bottom-up pattern matcher and contains has
no code generation heuristics per se. This utility only finds patterns in the
opt0.dag and opt1.dag which match the sequences in the .dat file and emits
the corresponding assembly for the subtree.

The opt0.dag is used at optimization level 0 and 1 (dag2gs2 -O0) and contains
the basic DAGs required to compile a file. The -O0 mode is useful for quickly
isolating bugs in the opt1.dag file.

The opt1.dag is used at optimization level 1 (dag2gs2 -O1) and contains
peephole optimizations which improve the code generation. This mode is used
for full optimization.

Note that this package can be easily ported to other accumulator-based
processors (such as the 6502, Z80, etc) by simply writing new opt0.dag and
opt1.dag datafiles.

Testing
----------------------------------------------------

To test the installation, cd to gen0/vax-bsd and type:

lcc -S test.c
mv test.s test.dag
dag2gs2 test.dag test.s

This distribution is not very polished but it is fairly stable
and has compiled a full standard C library.
